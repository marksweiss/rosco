# Rosco GUI/TUI Specifications

This directory contains comprehensive research and implementation plans for adding user interfaces to the Rosco music composition toolkit.

## Research Documents

### [TUI vs GUI Requirements](tui_vs_gui_requirements.md)
Comprehensive comparison of Terminal User Interface vs Graphical User Interface approaches for music synthesizer software, including:
- User experience differences
- Technical implementation considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility considerations
- Music production workflow analysis

### [Rust UI Library Analysis](rust_ui_library_analysis.md)
Detailed evaluation of Rust UI and TUI libraries suitable for music software development:
- **TUI Libraries**: ratatui, cursive, crossterm
- **GUI Libraries**: egui, iced, tauri, slint, gtk-rs
- Performance characteristics and real-time audio compatibility
- Integration complexity and community support

## Implementation Plans

### [TUI Implementation Plan](tui_implementation_plan.md)
8-week implementation roadmap for terminal-based interface:
- **Technology Stack**: ratatui + crossterm
- **Timeline**: 4 phases covering synth controls, sequencer, effects, and optimization
- **Features**: Real-time parameter control, 8-track sequencer, keyboard-driven workflow
- **Target**: Power users, remote development, resource-constrained environments

### [GUI Implementation Plan](gui_implementation_plan.md)
12-week implementation roadmap for graphical interface:
- **Technology Stack**: egui with audio visualization
- **Timeline**: 4 phases covering GUI framework, visual sequencer, audio viz, and polish
- **Features**: Professional controls, real-time visualization, MIDI support, plugin compatibility
- **Target**: Novice users, professional music production, visual feedback

## Key Recommendations

### TUI Approach
- **Faster Development**: 8 weeks vs 12 weeks
- **Lower Resource Usage**: 20-50MB vs 100-300MB memory
- **Better for**: Expert users, automation, SSH access
- **Technology**: ratatui + crossterm

### GUI Approach  
- **Better User Experience**: Intuitive for beginners
- **Professional Features**: Audio visualization, hardware controller support
- **Industry Standard**: Matches professional DAW interfaces
- **Technology**: egui for real-time performance

## Next Steps

Both plans are designed to integrate seamlessly with Rosco's existing modular architecture. The TUI implementation is recommended as a first step to validate core functionality, followed by GUI development sharing the same backend systems.
