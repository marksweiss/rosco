# Filter Specification

This document specifies the filter functionality for the Rosco audio system.

## Overview

Filters are audio processing components that modify the frequency content of audio signals.

## Types of Filters

### Low Pass Filter
- Allows frequencies below a cutoff frequency to pass through
- Attenuates frequencies above the cutoff frequency

### High Pass Filter
- Allows frequencies above a cutoff frequency to pass through
- Attenuates frequencies below the cutoff frequency

### Band Pass Filter
- Allows frequencies within a specific range to pass through
- Attenuates frequencies outside this range

### Notch Filter
- Attenuates frequencies within a specific range
- Allows frequencies outside this range to pass through

## Parameters

- **Cutoff Frequency**: The frequency at which the filter begins to affect the signal
- **Resonance/Q**: Controls the sharpness of the filter response
- **Filter Type**: Determines the frequency response curve
- **Slope**: The rate of attenuation (dB/octave)

## Implementation Notes

- Filters should be implemented as real-time processing components
- Support for both static and dynamic (modulated) parameters
- Efficient computation for real-time audio processing
