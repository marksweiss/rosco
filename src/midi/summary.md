# MIDI Module

## Purpose
Provides MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) support and integration for the Rosco toolkit. This module enables communication with external MIDI devices and processing of MIDI data.

## Key Components
- **midi.rs**: Core MIDI processing and integration logic

## Architecture
The MIDI module bridges the gap between MIDI protocol and Rosco's internal audio representation, allowing:
- MIDI input processing
- MIDI data conversion to internal note representation
- Integration with external MIDI devices and software

## Dependencies
- Uses nodi library for MIDI processing
- Integrates with note module for MIDI-to-note conversion
- Works with audio_gen for MIDI-triggered sound generation

## Usage Patterns
- Processes incoming MIDI events and converts them to internal note structures
- Enables external control of Rosco compositions via MIDI controllers
- Supports MIDI file import and processing
- Facilitates integration with external DAWs and MIDI hardware
