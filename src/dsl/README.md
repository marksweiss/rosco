# Overview of Script Structure and Processing

When the script is parsed, the parser first creates a @track.rs `Vec<Track>`.

The parser then processes macro substitution declarations at the top of the script, before the first `Outer Block`. These declarations use the `let` keyword to bind expressions to identifiers for later reuse. Macro names can then be referenced throughout the script using the `$` prefix syntax (e.g., `$env1`).

It then reads each `Outer Block`. For each one, the parser creates a new `FixedTimeNoteSequence` and a new `TrackEffects`. The envelope, effects, and filters declared in the script are converted to their corresponding structs, `Envelope`, `Flanger`, `Delay`, `LFO`, and `LowPassFilter`. These are passed to the builder call to create the `TrackEffects`. If a panning value is specified in the sequence definition, the `TrackEffects` panning is set to that value and the number of channels is set to 2 for stereo output. Then a Track is built, setting its sequence to the new `FixedTimeNoteSequence` and its track_effects to the new `TrackEffects`.

After this the parser processes each line defining a new note declaration, constructing a `PlaybackNote` of either type `osc` for a `Note` based on its waveforms, or of type `samp` for `SampledNote`. Each note is added to the current sequence with any filters that were declared in the outer block.

After the last outer block, the parser constructs a `TrackGrid`, setting its tracks to the `Vec<Track>` and returns it.

## Track-Level Panning

Track-level panning can be specified as an optional parameter after the `num_steps` value in the `FixedTimeNoteSequence` declaration using the `panning` keyword followed by a float value. The panning value should be a float between -1.0 and 1.0, where:
- `-1.0` = full left panning
- `0.0` = center (no panning)
- `1.0` = full right panning

When panning is specified, the track automatically switches to stereo output (2 channels). If no panning is specified, the track uses mono output (1 channel) with a default panning of 0.0.

Examples:
- `FixedTimeNoteSequence dur Quarter tempo 120 num_steps 16 panning -0.5` (panned left)
- `FixedTimeNoteSequence dur Quarter tempo 120 num_steps 16 panning 0.3` (panned slightly right)
- `FixedTimeNoteSequence dur Quarter tempo 120 num_steps 16` (center, mono)

## Filter Effects

Filters are audio processing components that modify the frequency content of audio signals. They are applied to each note in an outer block.

### Low-Pass Filter

The low-pass filter attenuates frequencies above the cutoff frequency, allowing lower frequencies to pass through.

Syntax: `filter cutoff_frequency f32 resonance f32 mix f32`

Parameters:
- `cutoff_frequency`: The frequency in Hz where filtering begins (20Hz to 22050Hz)
- `resonance`: Q factor controlling filter sharpness (0.0 to 1.0)
- `mix`: Blend between original and filtered signal (0.0 = dry, 1.0 = fully filtered)

Example:
```
FixedTimeNoteSequence dur Quarter tempo 120 num_steps 16
filter cutoff_frequency 1000.0 resonance 0.3 mix 0.8
osc:sine:440.0:0.5:0
```

Multiple filters can be applied to the same notes:
```
FixedTimeNoteSequence dur Quarter tempo 120 num_steps 16
filter cutoff_frequency 500.0 resonance 0.2 mix 0.6
filter cutoff_frequency 2000.0 resonance 0.5 mix 0.4
osc:sine:440.0:0.5:0
```

# DSL Syntax Specification

- Expressions are ALL_CAPS
- Terminals are a sequence upper- and/or lower-case characters and possibly other ASCII characters
- `+` means "one or more"
- `*` means "zero or more"
- `{1}` means "exactly one"
- `|` indicates alternation
- `.` represents any chracter
