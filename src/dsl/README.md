# Overview of Script Structure and Processing

When the script is parsed, the parser first creates a @track.rs `Vec<Track>`.

The parser then processes macro substitution declarations at the top of the script, before the first `Outer Block`. These declarations use the `let` keyword to bind expressions to identifiers for later reuse. Macro names can then be referenced throughout the script using the `$` prefix syntax (e.g., `$env1`).

It then reads each `Outer Block`. For each one, the parser creates a new `FixedTimeNoteSequence` and a new `TrackEffects`. The envelope and effects declared in the script are converted to their corresponding structs, `Envelope`, `Flanger`, `Delay` and `LFO`. These are passed to the builder call to create the `TrackEffects`. Then a Track is built, setting its sequence to the new `FixedTimeNoteSequence` and its track_effects to the new `TrackEffects`.

After this the parser processes each line defining a new note declaration, constructing a `PlaybackNote` of either type `osc` for a `Note` based on its waveforms, or of type `samp` for `SampledNote`. Each note is added to the current sequence.

After the last outer block, the parser constructs a `TrackGrid`, setting its tracks to the `Vec<Track>` and returns it.

# DSL Syntax Specification

- Expressions are ALL_CAPS
- Terminals are a sequence upper- and/or lower-case characters and possibly other ASCII characters
- `+` means "one or more"
- `*` means "zero or more"
- `{1}` means "exactly one"
- `|` indicates alternation
- `.` represents any chracter
