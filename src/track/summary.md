# Track Module

## Purpose
Manages audio tracks with integrated effects processing and grid-based organization. This module provides the high-level structure for organizing and processing musical content.

## Key Components
- **track.rs**: Core track implementation and management
- **track_effects.rs**: Effects processing chain for tracks
- **track_grid.rs**: Grid-based track organization and management

## Architecture
The track module provides:
- **Track**: Individual audio track with sequence and effects
- **TrackEffects**: Effects processing chain including filters, panning, delay, flanger, LFO, and ADSR envelopes
- **TrackGrid**: Grid-based organization of multiple tracks for complete compositions

Tracks support:
- Multiple filters per track with configurable order
- Stereo panning control (-1.0 to 1.0)
- Complete effects processing chain
- ADSR envelope application

## Dependencies
- Uses sequence module for note content
- Integrates with effect module for audio processing
- Works with filter module for frequency manipulation
- Uses envelope module for amplitude control
- Connects to audio_gen for final audio output

## Usage Patterns
- Tracks combine sequences with effects processing
- TrackGrid organizes multiple tracks into complete compositions
- Effects are applied in a configurable processing chain
- Panning provides stereo field positioning
- Multiple tracks can be layered and mixed for complex arrangements
