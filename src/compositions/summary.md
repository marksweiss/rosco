## Purpose
Contains actual musical compositions created using the Rosco toolkit. This module serves as a collection of example compositions and demonstrates the capabilities of the system.

## Key Components
- **computer_punk_001.rs**: Electronic/punk style composition
- **computer_punk_003.rs**: Another electronic/punk style composition
- **dsl_1.rs**: Composition demonstrating DSL usage (currently the default composition)

## Architecture
Each composition file typically contains a function that returns a TrackGrid or similar structure representing the complete musical piece. Compositions showcase different aspects of the Rosco system.

## Dependencies
- Uses all core modules (audio_gen, track, sequence, note, etc.)
- May use DSL for composition definition
- Integrates with effects and filters for audio processing

## Usage Patterns
- Compositions are typically invoked from main.rs
- Each composition demonstrates different techniques and capabilities
- Serves as both example code and functional music pieces
- dsl_1 is currently the default composition that runs when executing `cargo run`
