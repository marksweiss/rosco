# Composition Module

## Purpose
Provides high-level composition utilities and tools for creating and managing musical compositions. This module offers abstractions for working with complete musical pieces.

## Key Components
- **comp_utils.rs**: Composition utility functions and helpers

## Architecture
The composition module acts as a high-level interface for creating musical compositions, building upon the foundational components from other modules like tracks, sequences, and notes.

## Dependencies
- Uses track module for track management
- Integrates with sequence module for note sequencing
- Works with note module for musical content

## Usage Patterns
- Provides utilities for composing complete musical pieces
- Offers higher-level abstractions over raw track and sequence manipulation
- Serves as a bridge between the DSL and the lower-level audio generation components
